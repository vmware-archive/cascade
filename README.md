FPGAs can exceed the performance of general-purpose CPUs by several orders of
magnitude and offer dramatically lower cost and time to market than ASICs.
While the benefits are substantial, programming an FPGA can be an extremely
slow process. Trivial programs can take several minutes to compile using a
traditional compiler, and complex designs can take hours or longer. 

Cascade is a novel solution to this problem, the world's first just-in-time
compiler for Verilog. Cascade executes code immediately in a software
simulator, and performs compilation in the background. When compilation is
finished, the code is moved into hardware, and from the userâ€™s perspective it
simply gets faster over time. Cascade's ability to move code back and forth
between software and hardware also makes it the first platform to provide
generic support for the execution of unsynthesizable Verilog from hardware. The
effects are substantial. Cascade encourages more frequent compilation, reduces
the time required for developers to produce working hardware designs, and
transforms HDL development into something which closely resembes writing
JavaScript or Python. It takes the first steps towards bridging the gap between
programming software and programming hardware.

Much of the work which has gone into building Cascade has been documented in
conference proceedings. A complete list of publications (hopefully with more to
come) is below. Note however, that Cascade is under active development. In some
cases, its implementation may have diverged what is described in these
texts. The most up-to-date information on Cascade's implementation is always
its source code.

Dependencies
=====
Cascade should build successfully on OSX and most Linux distributions. 

Building Cascade
=====
1. Clone this repository 
```
$ git clone https://github.com/vmware/cascade
```

2. Run the setup script

```bash
$ cd cascade
$ ./setup
```

The setup script should guide you through installing dependencies, as
well as configuring, building and testing Cascade.

Using Cascade
=====

### Command Line Interface

Start Cascade by typing
```
$ cascade
```
This will place you in a Read-Evaluate-Print-Loop (REPL). Code which is typed
here is appended to the source of the (initially empty) top-level (root) module
and evaluated immediately. Try defining a wire. 
```verilog
>>> wire x;
```
The Verilog specification requires that code inside of ```initial``` blocks is
executed exactly once when a program begins executing. Because Cascade is a
dynamic environment, we generalize that specification: code inside of
```initial``` blocks is executed exactly once immediately after it is compiled.
Try printing the value of the wire you just defined. Cascade uses a two-value model
for signals. Unknown logic values (X) are set to zero, and high-impedence values (Z)
are assigned non-deterministic values.
```verilog
>>> initial $display(x);
>>> 0
```
Now try printing a variable which hasn't been defined.
```verilog
>>> initial $display(y);
>>> Typechecker Error:
>>>  > In final line of user input:
>>>    Referenece to unresolved identifier: y
```
Anything you enter into the REPL is lexed, parsed, type-checked, and compiled.
If any part of this process fails, Cascade will produce an error message and
the remainder of your text will be ignored. If you type multiple statements,
anything which compiles successfully before the error is encountered cannot be
undone. Below, ```x``` and ```y``` are declared successfully, but the
redeclaration of ```x``` produces an error.
```verilog
>>> wire x,y,x;
>>> Typechecker Error:
>>>  > In final line of user input:
>>>    A variable named x already appears in this scope.
>>>    Previous declaration appears in previous user input.
>>> initial $display(y);
>>> 0
```
You can declare and instantiate modules from the REPL as well. Note however,
that  declarations will be type-checked in the global  scope. Variables which
you may have declared in the root module will not be visible here. It isn't
until a module is instantiated that it can access program state.
```verilog
>>> module Foo(
>>>   input wire x,
>>>   output wire y 
>>> );
>>>   assign y = x;
>>> endmodule
>>> wire q,r;
>>> Foo f(q,r);
```
If you don't want to type your entire program into the REPL you can use the
include statement, where ```path/``` is assumed to be relative to your current
working directory.
```verilog
>>> `include "path/to/file.v"
```
If you'd like to use additional search paths, you can start Cascade using the
```-I``` flag and provide a list of semicolon-separated alternatives. Cascade
will try each of these paths as a prefix, in order, until it finds a match.
```
$ cascade -I path/to/dir1:path/to/dir2
```
Alternately, you can start Cascade with the ```-e``` flag and the name of a file to include.
```
$ cascade -e path/to/file.v
```
Finally, Cascade will stop running whenever a program invokes the ```$finish``` task.
```verilog
>>> initial $finish;
Goodbye!
```
You can also force a shutdown by typing ```Ctrl-C``` or ```Ctrl-D```.
```verilog
>>> module Foo(); wir... I give up... arg... ^C
```

### As a Library

Cascade can also be called directly from C++ code. Cascade's command line interface
is a thin-wrapper around a small set of functions. A minimal example 
is shown below. Further dicussion of the concepts in this example appears in subsequent
sections of this README. 

```c++
#include <cassert>
#include <iostream>
#include <sstream>
#include <cascade.h>

using namespace cascade;
using namespace std;

int main() {
    // Create an instance of Cascade. Cascade is thread-safe. Multiple instances
    // may share the same address space.
    Cascade cascade;
    
    // Configuration options. These methods should all be called before
    // cascade starts running.
    cascade.set_include_dirs(...);
    cascade.set_enable_inlining(...);
    cascade.set_open_loop_target(...);
    cascade.set_quartus_server(...);
    cascade.set_profile_interval(...);

    // Cascade exposes its six i/o streams (the standard STDIN, STDOUT, and
    // STDERR, along with  three additional STDWARN, STDINFO, STDLOG) as
    // C++ streambufs. These are initially mapped to nullptr. Changes to this
    // mapping should also be made before cascade starts running.
    cascade.set_stdin(cin.rdbuf());
    cascade.set_stdout(cout.rdbuf());
    cascade.set_stderr(cerr.rdbuf());
    cascade.set_stdwarn(cerr.rdbuf());
    cascade.set_stdinfo(clog.rdbuf());
    cascade.set_stdlog(...);
    
    // Start cascade. This method returns immediately.
    cascade.run();
    
    // Cascade will run until the user's program invokes the $finish() task or the 
    // user requests that it stop running. The request_stop() method returns immediately. 
    // The wait_for_stop() method will block until either of the above conditions
    // is satisified.
    cascade.request_stop();
    cascade.wait_for_stop();
    
    // Stopping cascade only pauses its execution. All previous state is retained.
    // To continue running, call run() again.
    cascade.run();
    
    // Cascade is a c++ ostream. While it is running, any text provided to it
    // via the << operator, will be eval'ed. Since every program must begin with an
    // march file, you can use an include statement to eval one.
    cascade << "`include \"path/to/march.v\"";
    
    // Because cascade runs asynchronously, it has no way of knowing when user input
    // has ended. The user can force this by using the flush() method, or passing 
    // cascade a c++ endl. Be careful with using endl to separate multi-line inputs.
    // This may cause cascade to prematurely evaluate user input. When in doubt, prefer '\n'.
    cascade.flush(); 
    cascade << endl;
    
    // The results of the eval statements which have taken place since the previous
    // flush are available through ostream status bits. Cascade is placed in
    // in the eof state when it encounters an eof character, and in the bad state when
    // an eval results in a parse or type error. Because cascade runs asynchronously, the 
    // only way to make sure an eval has run to completion is to request a stop. The standard
    // mechanism for clearing an ostream's state bits is to use the clear() method.
    
    assert(!cascade.bad()); // Not guaranteed to see the result of the previous eval.
    cascade.stop_now(); // Syntactic sugar for request_stop(); wait_for_stop();
    assert(!cascade.bad()); // Both guaranteed to see the result of the previous eval.
    assert(!cascade.eof()); 
    cascade.clear(); // Clears eof and bad bits.
    
    // While cascade is stopped, it is safe to replace its rdbuf. For example:
    stringstream ss("wire x; initial $display(\"Hello, world!\");");
    cascade.rdbuf(ss.rdbuf());
    cascade.run();
    
    // Note however, that most c++ implementations assign non-standard semantics to
    // cin. It's safe to switch cascade's rdbuf to cin. But once this is done, it is
    // no longer safe to change it again.
    cascade.stop_now();
    cascade.rdbuf(cin.rdbuf());
    cascade.rdbuf(ss.rdbuf()); // UNDEFINED!
    cascade.run();
    
    // Block until the user's program invokes the $finish() task.
    cascade.wait_for_stop();

    return 0;
}
```

To build a program that uses Cascade as a library, statically link against libcascade. If you installed cascade to a directory
other than ```/usr/local/``` you'll need to provide alternate values for the ```-I``` and ```-L``` flags.

```
$ g++ --std=c++17 -I/usr/local/include/cascade my_program.cc -lcascade
```

Environments
=====

### Software Backend
By default, Cascade runs in software. You can invoke this
behavior explicitly using the ```--sw``` flag.
```
$ cascade --march sw
```
This environment declares the following module and instantiates it into the
top-level module for you:
```verilog
module Clock(
  output wire val
);
endmodule

Clock clock;
```
This module represents the global clock. Its value toggles between zero and one
every cycle. Try typing the following (and remember that you can type Ctrl-C to
quit):
```verilog
>>> always @(clock.val) $display(clock.val);
>>> 0
>>> 1
>>> 0
>>> 1
>>> ...
```
This global clock can be used to implement sequential circuits, such as the
barrel shifter shown below.
```verilog
>>> module BShift(
>>>   input wire clk,
>>>   output reg[7:0] val
>>> );
>>>   always @(posedge clk) begin
>>>     val <= (val == 8'h80) ? 8'h01 : (val << 1);
>>>   end
>>> endmodule
>>> wire[7:0] x;
>>> BShift bs(clock.val, x);
```
Compared to a traditional compiler which assumes a fixed clock rate, Cascade's
clock is *virtual*: the amount of time between ticks can vary from one cycle to
the next, and is a function of both how large your program and is and how often
and how much I/O it performs. This abstraction is the key mechanism by which
Cascade is able to move programs between software and hardware without
involving the user.  

Up until this point the code we've looked at has been entirely compute-based. 
However most hardware programs involve the use of I/O
peripherals. Before we get into real hardware, first try running Cascade's
virtual software FPGA.
```
$ sw_fpga
```
Cascade's virtual FPGA provides an ncurses GUI with four buttons, one reset,
and eight leds. You can toggle the buttons using the ```1 2 3 4``` keys, toggle
the reset using the ```r``` key, and shut down the virtual FPGA by typing
```q```. Cascade's software backend will automatically detect the virtual FPGA and expose its peripherals
as modules which are implicitly declared and instantiated in the top-level
module:
```verilog
module Pad(
  output wire[3:0] val
);
endmodule
Pad pad();

module Reset(
  output wire val
);
endmodule
Reset reset();

module Led(
  output wire[7:0] val
);
endmodule
Led led();
```
Try writing a simple program that connects the pads to the leds.
```verilog
>>> assign led.val = pad.val;
```
Toggling the pads should now change the values of the leds for as long as
Cascade is running.

### Hardware Backends
Cascade currently provides support for two hardware backends: the [Terasic
DE10 Nano
SoC](https://www.terasic.com.tw/cgi-bin/page/archive.pl?Language=English&No=1046)
and the [ULX3S](https://radiona.org/ulx3s/). When Cascade is run on either of these targets, instead of mapping compute and leds
onto virtual components, it can map them directly onto real hardware.

### DE10 Nano

Before using the de10 backend you'll first need to install [Intel's Quartus Lite IDE](http://fpgasoftware.intel.com/?edition=lite) on a network-accessible 64-bit Linux machine. You'll also need to run Cascade's compilation server on that machine.
```
$ quartus_server --path <quartus/install/dir> --port 9900
```

Alternatively, you can use Quartus Lite IDE installed on a remote host:
```
$ quartus_server --tunnel-command <command/like/ssh> --path <quartus/install/dir> --port 9900
```

Next you'll need an SD card image for your DE10 which is compatible with Cascade.  Any embedded version of Ubuntu will do, but a pre-built image is available [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1EnwC3NOevqvTYvIEnHfXCSK_7UKwBWwi). Flash the image onto an SD card, reboot your DE10, and log in using the username/password ```fpga```/```fpga```. You can log in either over the UART port using an application such as screen, over the USB port using ssh over USB using the static IP ```192.168.7.1```, or over the network port using ssh (though you'll need to login through another means first to determine the IP assigned by DHCP).

Once you are logged in, you can run Cascade as usual (IMPORTANT: but on the DE10, use sudo).
```
$ cd cascade
$ sudo cascade --march de10 --quartus_host <64-bit Linux IP> --quartus_port <64-bit Linux port>
```
As Cascade is under active development, you may wish to first type ```git pull``` and perform a fresh rebuild to take advantage of any recent bug fixes.

Assuming Cascade is able to successfully connect to the FPGA fabric, you will
be presented with a similar environment to the one you encountered when using the software backend. The only
difference is that instead of a Reset module, Cascade will implicitly declare
the following module, which represents the DE10's Arduino header.
```verilog
module GPIO(
  input wire[7:0] val
);
endmodule
GPIO gpio();
```

Try repeating the example from the previous section and watch real buttons
toggle real leds.

### ULX3S

Cascade supports the ULX3S using the entirely open source [Yosys](http://www.clifford.at/yosys/)->[NextPNR](https://github.com/YosysHQ/nextpnr)->[ujprog](https://github.com/f32c/tools/tree/master/ujprog) toolchain. Before getting started, you'll need to follow the directions [here](https://github.com/SymbiFlow/prjtrellis) for installing Yosys and NextPNR, and [here](https://github.com/f32c/tools/tree/master/ujprog) for installing ujprog. Make sure that all components are installed to the standard ```/usr/local``` directory tree.

Next, you should be able to run Cascade as usual.
``` bash
$ cascade --march ulx3s
```

Cascade does not currently support any of the I/O peripherals on the ULX3s, but it can target its reprogrammable fabric to improve virtual clock frequency for most applications.

### JIT Compilation

If you'd like more information on how Cascade transitions  code between
software and hardware, trying using the ```--enable_info``` flag. This will cause Cascade to print
status updates to the REPL whenever part of your program begins execution in a new context.
``` bash
$ cascade --enable_info
```

In general, you can expect your virtual clock frequency to increase as more and more of your logic
transitions to hardware. Providing the ```--profile <n>``` flag will cause Cascade to periodically (every
<n> seconds) print the current time and Cascade's virtual clock frequency to the REPL. To see this effect, try executing a very long-running program.
```
$ cascade --march <sw|de10|ulx3s> -e share/cascade/test/benchmark/bitcoin/run_25.v --enable_info --profile 3
```

Support for Synthesizable Verilog
=====
Cascade currently supports a large --- though certainly not complete --- subset
of the Verilog 2005 Standard. The following partial list should give a good
impression of what Cascade is capable of.

Support for Unsynthesizable Verilog
=====

Cascade provides support for many of the unsynthesizable system tasks which are
described in the 2005 specification, along with a few others which are unique
to a just-in-time enviornment. One of the things that makes Cascade so powerful
is that it supports the execution of unsynthesizable systems tasks *even when a
program is running in hardware*. With Cascade, there's no reason to shy away
from the use of ```$display()``` as a debugging tool. Unsynthesizable system
tasks are guaranteed to run correctly on every target.

A complete listing of the system tasks which Cascade supports, along with a
brief description of their behavior is shown below.

| Feature Class         | Feature                     | Supported | In Progress | Will Not Support |

|                       | $write(fmt, args...)        |  x        |             |                  |
| Scanf                 | $scanf(fmt, args...)        |  x        |             |                  |
| Debugging             | $monitor(var)               |           | x           |                  |

|                       | $error(fmt, args...)        |  x        |             |                  |

|                       | $restart(file)              |  x        |             |                  |
|                       | $retarget(march)            |  x        |             |                  |

|                       | $fclose(fd)                 |           | x           |                  |
|                       | $fdisplay(fd, fmt, args...) |  x        |             |                  |
|                       | $feof(fd)                   |  x        |             |                  |
|                       | $fflush(fd)                 |  x        |             |                  |
|                       | $fgetc(fd)                  |           | x           |                  |
|                       | $fgets(str, fd)             |           | x           |                  |
|                       | $fread(fd, var)             |  x        |             |                  |
|                       | $fscanf(fd, fmt, args...)   |  x        |             |                  |
|                       | $fseek(fd, off, dir)        |  x        |             |                  |
|                       | $ftell(fd)                  |           | x           |                  |
|                       | $fwrite(fd, fmt, args...)   |  x        |             |                  |
|                       | $rewind(fd, off, dir)       |  x        |             |                  |
|                       | $ungetc(c, dir)             |           | x           |                  |


#### Printf Tasks

The printf family of system tasks can be used to emit debugging statements to
stdout (the REPL). Both use the same printf-style of argument passing. A
formatting string which may be delimitted with variable placeholders (```%d,
%x, etc...```) is followed by a list of program variables whose runtime values
are substituted for those placeholders. Both printf-style system tasks behave
identically. The only difference is that ```$display()``` automatically appends
a newline character to the end of its output.

#### Scanf

The scan system task can be used to read values from stdin. However this
feature is only useful when Cascade is used as a library, as when Cascade is
run in a REPL, it dedicates stdin to parsing code.

### Debugging Tasks

The debugging-family of system tasks can be used to print information about
the program which Cascade is currently running. ```$list``` displays source code,
```$showvars``` displays information about program variables, and ```$showscopes```
displays information about program scopes.

#### Logging Tasks

The logging-family of system tasks behave identically to the printf-family of
system tasks. The only difference is that their output can be filtered based on
the arguments that you provide when you run Cascade. By default,
```$warning()``` and ```$error()``` messages are printed to the REPL. You can
disable this behavior off by running Cascade with the ```--disable_warning```
and ```--disable_error``` flags. In contrast, ```$info()``` messages are not
printed to the REPL by default. You can enable this behavior by running Cascade
with the ```--enable_info``` flag.

#### Simulation Control Tasks

The ```$finish()``` system task can be used to shut Cascade down
programmatically. Evaluating the ```$finish()``` task with an argument other
than 0 will cause Cascade to emit a status message before shutting down. You
can think of the ```$fatal()``` system task as a combination of the
```$finish()``` and ```$error()``` system tasks. The following two programs are
identical.

``` verilog
initial $fatal(1, "format string %d", 42);
```
``` verilog
initial begin
  $error("format string %d", 42);
  $finish(1);
end
```

#### Virtualization Tasks

While Cascade was originally designed as a developer aid, its ability to break
a program into pieces and move those pieces seamlessly between software and
hardware turns out to be the key engineering primitive which is necessary for
FPGA virtualization. The virtualization-family of system tasks expose this
functionality. 

The ```$save()``` and ```$restart()``` tasks can be used to save the state of a
running program to a file, and then reload that state at a later tmie rather
than having to run the program again from scratch. The following example shows
how to configure two buttons to suspend and resume the execution of a program.

```verilog
always @(pad.val) begin
  if (pad.val[0]) begin
    $save("path/to/file");
    $finish;
  end else if (pad.val[1]) begin
    $restart("path/to/file");
  end
```

The ```$retarget()``` task can be used to reconfigure Cascade as though it was
run with a different ```--march``` file while a program is executing. This may
be valuable for transitioning a running program from one hardware target to
another. The following example shows how to configure two buttons to toggle the
use of JIT-compilation mid-execution.

```verilog
always @(pad.val) begin
  if (pad.val[0]) begin
    $retarget("de10");
  end else bif (pad.val[1]) begin
    $retarget("de10_jit");
  end
end
```

#### File I/O Tasks 

The family of file i/o tasks provide an abstract mechanism for interacting with
file streams. The following example shows how to read the contents of a file,
one cycle at a time. Note that ```$fread()``` is sensitive to the size of its
second argument and will read as many bytes as necessary to produce a value for
that variable.

```verilog
integer s = $fopen("path/to/file", "r");
reg[31:0] x = 0;

always @(posedge clock.val) begin
  $fread(s, x);
  if ($feof(s)) begin
    $finish;
  end
  $display(x);
end
```

The following example shows how you can use both ```$fread()``` and
```$fwrite()``` tasks in conjunction with the ```$feof``` task to stream data
to and from your program, regardless of whether it is running in software or
hardware.

```verilog
module Compute(
  input  wire[31:0] x,
  output wire[31:0] y
);
  assign y = 2 * x;
endmodule;

reg[31:0]  x;
wire[31:0] y;
Compute c(x,y);

integer i = $fopen("path/to/input", "r");
integer o = $fopen("path/to/output");
always @(posedge clock.val) begin
  $fread(i, x);
  if ($feof(i)) begin
    $finish;
  end  
  $fwrite(o, "%x", y);
end
```

In addition to the tasks described above, the ```$fseek()``` task can be used
to reset the position from which ```$fread()``` tasks are performed. Note that
Cascade uses an eventual consistency model for ```$fdisplay()``` statements.
Attempting to interleave reads and writes to the same stream may result in
unexpected behavior unless the user forces a sync by invoking the
```$fflush()``` task.

Standard Library
=====

In addition to supporting both synthesizable and unsynthesizable Verilog,
Cascade also provides a Standard Library of I/O peripherals. You can think of
this library as an abstract representation of target-specific hardware. By
targeting the components in Cascade's Standard Library, rather than the
specific peripherals associated with a hardware target, there is a good chance
that your program will run in multiple environments without modification. We've
already seen examples of many of the peripherals in Cascade's Standard Library.
A complete listing, along with the ```--march``` targets which support them, is
shown below.

| Component | sw | de10 | ulx3s    |
|:----------|:--:|:----:|:--------:|
| Clock     | x  | x    | x        |
| Led       | x  | x    |          |
| Pad       | x  | x    |          |
| Reset     | x  |      |          |
| GPIO      |    | x    |          |

Target-Specific Components
=====

Some ```--march``` targets may instantiate modules which serve as wrappers
around target-specific hardware features. For example, a target might provide a
```Bram``` module to expose a particular type of storage, or a ```Pcie```
module to expose a particular type of I/O. While these wrappers will typically
expose the highest levels of performance to the user, they do so at the price
of portability. Writing a program which relies on a particular low-level
feature makes it unlikely that Cascade will be able to execute that program on
an ```--march``` target other than the one it was designed for.

The target-specific hardware features exposed by an ```--march``` target, along
with the standard library components it supports, can be displayed by running
Cascade with the ```--enable_info``` flag.

Adding Support for New Backends
=====

Adding support for a new backend begins with writing an ```--march``` file.
This file will contain instantiations for the Standard Library components that
your backend supports, as well as any target-specific components you wish to
make available to the user. This file should also contain an ```$info()```
message which describes this support, along with anything else you'd like the
user to know. Save this file as ```data/march/my_backend.v```. Once you've done
so, you can run Cascade with the ```--march my_backend``` flag. An example is
shown below.

```verilog
`ifndef __MY_BACKEND_V
`define __MY_BACKEND_V

// An --march file must first include the declarations in the Standard Library
`include "data/stdlib/stdlib.v"

// Next, an --march file must instantiate the root module. The __target annotation is 
// used to pass information to the Cascade compiler about how to compile the user's code. 
// __target is a semicolon-separated list of backend compilation passes to use. If only one 
// value is provided as below, then Cascade will not run in JIT-mode. To enable JIT-mode, 
// use the following string instead: "sw;my_backend".
(* __target="my_backend" *)
Root root();

// At a minimum, a backend must instantiate a global Standard Library clock
// which will never leave software. Any code which follows the instantiation of
// the root is placed inside of the root, and any instantiations which appear
// inside of the root inherit its annotations. The __target="sw" annotation
// overrides the value you placed on the root and guarantees that this module
// will never leave software simulation.
(* __target="sw" *)
Clock clock();

// This instantiation will expose an abstract bank of four Standard Library
// LEDs.  As above, the __target="my_backend" annotation overrides the value
// you placed on the root. This ensures that this module will be compiled
// directly to your backend rather than beginning execution in software
// simulation.
(* __target="my_backend" *)
Led#(4) led();

// This declaration will expose a target-specific pci connection.
// Target-specific declaration only need to specify their input and output
// pins. The actual implementation will be provided by your compiler.
module Pci();
  input wire ...
  output wire ...
endmodule

// This instantiation will expose your target-specific module. The __std="pci"
// annotation will be used to distinguish this instantiation from user code. As
// above, the __target="my_backend" annotation overrides the value you placed
// on the root.
(* __std="pci", __target="my_backend" *)
Pci pci();

// At this point you may have noticed that an  --march file is just Verilog
// code which is run before transferring control to the user. Now that your
// environment is set up, in addition to $info() statements, you could place
// any arbitrary code here as well. 
initial begin
  $info("My Backend");
  $info(" Supports the following Standard Library Components: Clock, Led");
  $info(" Supports the following Target-Specific Components: Pci");
end

`endif
```

Next, you'll need to create a compiler for your backend. Take a look at the
```CoreCompiler``` class which is defined in ```src/target/core_compiler.h```.
Your compiler must be a subclass of this type, and be able to compile user
logic as well as instantiations of any of the Standard Library components you
introduced in your ```--march``` file. For the example shown above, this means
that you would need to override the following methods:

```c++
virtual Led* compile_led(Interface* interface, ModuleDeclaration* md);
virtual Logic* compile_logic(Interface* interface, ModuleDeclaration* md);
```

Additionally, because the example contains at least one target-specific
component, you would also need to override the following method:

```c++
virtual Custom* compile_custom(Interface* interface, ModuleDeclaration* md);
```

Details on implementing these methods can be found in
```src/target/core_compiler.h```. In short, the goal of this class is transform
a ```ModuleDeclaration``` (Verilog source code) for an instantiated module into
a ```Core``` (target-specific executable implementation of that code), of which
```Led```, ```Logic```, and ```Custom``` are sub-types, whose implementation
relies on an ```Interface``` (which will be compiled for you) to communicate
back and forth with the Cascade runtime as necessary.

The definitions for ```Core``` and ```Interface``` can be found in
```src/target/core.h``` and ```src/target/interface.h``` respectively. Your
compiler will need to return target-specific instances of these classes. Both
files contain detailed information on the invariants that Cascade imposes on
the implementation of a ```Core``` and the functionality provided by an
```Interface```. Briefly, a ```Core``` is responsible for implementing support
for the Cascade runtime ABI. This ABI is the mechanism by which Cascade
orchestrates the communication and computation necessary to satisfy the
semantics of Verilog while at the same time providing support for the
just-in-time features described above. 

Once you've finished implementing your compiler, you'll need to register it by
adding a few lines of code to ```src/cascade/cascade.cc```.
```c++
Cascade::Cascade() : eval_(this), iostream(&sb_), sb_() {
  // ...
  runtime_.get_compiler()->set("sw", new SwCompiler());
  runtime_.get_compiler()->set("my_backend", new MyBackendCompiler());
  // ...
}
```

Rebuild your source and... everything should just work... Happy debugging!

FAQ
====

#### Flex fails during build with an error related to yyin even though I'm using version 2.6 or greater.
Some package managers fail to update the flex header file ```FlexLexer.h``` when upgrading versions.
Locate your copy of ```FlexLexer.h``` and look up the definition of ```yyFlexLexer::yyin```. If 
this variable has type ```std::istream*```, your file is out of date and you will need to patch it. 
The current version of this file, which should have been installed can be found in Flex's top-level 
```src/``` directory.


#### Cascade emits strange warnings whenever I declare a module.
Module declarations are typechecked in the global scope, separate from the rest
of your program. While this allows Cascade to catch many errors at
declaration-time, there are some properties of Verilog programs which can only
be verified at instantiation-time. If Cascade emits a warning, it is generally
because it cannot statically prove that the module you declared will
instantiate correctly in every possible program context.  

#### Why does Cascade warn that x is undeclared when I declare Foo, but not when I instantiate it (Part 1)?
```verilog
localparam x = 0;
module Foo();
  wire q = x;
endmodule
Foo f();
```
The local parameter ```x``` was declared in the root module, and the module
```Foo``` was declared in its own scope. In general, there is no way for
Cascade to guarantee that you will instantiate ```Foo``` in a context where all
of its declaration-time unresolved variables will be resolvable. In this case,
it is statically provable, but Cascade doesn't know how to do so. When
```Foo``` is instantiated, Cascade can verify that there is a variable named
```p``` which is reachable from the scope in which ```f``` appears. No further
warnings or errors are necessary. Here is a more general example:
```verilog
module Foo();
  assign x.y.z = 1;
endmodule

// ...
begin : x
  begin : y
    reg z;
  end
end
// ...
Foo f(); // This instantiation will succeed because a variable named z
         // is reachable through the hierarchical name x.y.z from f.
         
// ...
begin : q
  reg r;
end
// ...
Foo f(); // This instantiation will fail because the only variable
         // reachable from f is q.r.
```

#### Why does Cascade warn that x is undeclared when I declare Foo, but not when I instantiate it (Part 2)?
```verilog
module #(parameter N) Foo();
  genvar i;
  for (i = 0; i < N; i=i+1) begin : GEN
    reg x;
  end
  wire q = GEN[5].x;
endmodule
Foo#(8) f();
```
The register ```x``` was declared in a loop generate construct with bounds
determined by a parameter. In general, there is no way for Cascade to guarantee
that you will instantiate ```Foo``` with a parameter binding such that all of
its declaration-time unresolved variables are resolvable. When ```Foo``` is
instantiated with ```N=8```, Cascade can verify that there is a variable named
```GEN[5].x```. No further warnings or errors are necessary.

More generally, Cascade will defer typechecking for code that appears inside of
generate constructs until instantiation-time.

#### I get it, but it seems like there's something about pretty much every module declaration that Cascade can't prove.
The truth hurts. Remember that if you'd like to disable warnings you can type.
```
$ cascade --disable_warning
```
